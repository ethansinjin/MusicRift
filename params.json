{"name":"MusicRift","tagline":"Navigate your music using Oculus Rift and Myo!","body":"The Oculus Rift is an extraordinary device that tracks your movements to assist in an accurate reproduction of virtual surroundings. Most people think of video games when they think of the rift. However, there is more that can be accomplished with such a device.\r\n\r\nThe Myo is a bluetooth-enabled armband that tracks your muscle impulses to identify gestures. It can currently be used to control apps on your computer, but there is much more that it is capable of.\r\n\r\nIt would be really cool if you could combine the two devices somehow and use them for something somewhat fun, like controlling your music.\r\nBut that's crazy. The amount of work required to achieve something like that would be insane. There's no way that two college freshman could build a fully functional prototype of this behavior in a week, much less 24 hours.\r\n\r\nBut we did.\r\n\r\nMusicRift allows you to view album art from your iTunes library in a 3D environment, complete with mountains and pretty fireworks. Myo allows the user to simply move their hand over the song they want played, and make a fist. It's really that simple.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
