MusicRift
=========

Navigate your music using Oculus Rift and Myo!
Build this project in Unity Pro. It includes the Oculus SDK and Myo Unity Plugin 
(which may be a no-no, and why this code isn't under the GNU)
You'll need two AppleScripts to interface with iTunes that aren't in this repo, 
although it's pretty easy to just roll your own.
Use an iTunes playlist called 'Oculus'.
